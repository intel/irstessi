.TH SsiRescan 3 "September 28, 2011" "version 0.1" "Linux Programmer's Reference"
.SH NAME
SsiRescan - forces the driver and/or system to scan for hardware changes
on the system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <ssi.h>

.BI "SSI_Status SsiRescan();"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B Note:
This function is here for compatibility purposes only. Not 
implemented under \fBLinux\fR.

Forces the driver and/or system to scan for hardware changes. In some 
implementations and hardware, addition or removal of hardware is not 
dynamically detected. In those implementations, a mechanism is needed to 
trigger an explicit search for hardware changes. This API will trigger that 
explicit search.

As bus re-enumeration may take multiple seconds to tens of seconds on some 
systems, consumers of this API should be aware that this call may not return 
immediately.
.PP
.B Return value
.IP
\fBSSI_StatusOk\fR - The operation completed successfully.
.br
\fBSSI_StatusNotInitialized\fR - Indicates that the system has not been 
initialized.
.br
\fBSSI_StatusFailed\fR - The call failed to complete successfully.
.br
\fBSSI_StatusNotSupported\fR - The action is not supported.
