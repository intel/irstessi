1. Overview

The RAID Management API allows complete management of the Intel Storage
systems based on a RAID controller included in the Intel chipset.
This API allows end user to manage these systems from their proprietary
RAID management application which simplifies tasks associated with
the RAID system management.

The RAID API is developed as Linux shared library (so). This library
manages and configures the Intel RAID driver using mdadm application
and issues IOCTL calls to get some information from the OS.
The API exposed to the RAID Management Application can be executed
via function calls.

NOTE: mdadm configuration file /etc/mdadm.conf will be overwritten
when library is loaded. Previous version is saved as /etc/mdadm.conf.original

3. Dependences

To build SSI API library from source code the package sg3_utils-devel
is required.

For correct functioning mdadm version 4.0 minimum is required.
The mdadm source code is available to download from
http://git.neil.brown.name/?p=mdadm.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/tags/mdadm-4.0
