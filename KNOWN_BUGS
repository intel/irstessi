SSI API ver. 1.0-1 3/13/2012

SsiExpandVolume:
Function is implemented however this functionality depends on mdadm. During this release mdadm did not support such functionality.
Tested on mdadm 3.2.3. Future releases of mdadm may support this functionality.

SsiVolumeDelete:
Function doesn't work properly on raid in reshape state however this functionality depends on mdadm.

SsiPhyLocate:
For proper functioning ledmon/ledctrl must intalled on the system. See ledmon package for more details (https://sourceforge.net/projects/ledmon/)

Issue:
Any operation on RAID 0 performed outside CIM/SSI API will not be visible inside CIM/SSI API. This is because mdadm is not monitoring RAID 0.
Workaround:
Workaround for this issue is to run 'ssimsg' program after each operation performed on RAID 0. Ssimsg is a part of SSI API package.

Issue:
Some operations like raid creation perfomed outside CIM/SSI API (except RAID 0 which is described above) will be visible in CIM/SSI API
with some delay. It depends on the system state and it could take even 2 minutes.
Workaround:
Workaround for this issue is to run 'ssimsg' program after each operation performed manually on RAIDs outside of CIM/SSI API.
Ssimsg is a part of SSI API package.
